# Docker GPU Sandbox - Build Script
#
# USAGE:
#   ./build.sh              # Fast build (Intel/NVIDIA support only)
#   ./build.sh amd          # Full build with AMD GPU drivers (slower)
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Builds a Docker image with hardware OpenGL acceleration support.
#   The default build is optimized for speed and supports Intel integrated
#   graphics and NVIDIA GPUs. AMD GPU support can be enabled but requires
#   additional driver packages that significantly increase build time.
#
# IMAGES CREATED:
#   gpu-sandbox:gl          # Fast build (default)
#   gpu-sandbox:gl-amd      # With AMD GPU drivers
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   ./build.sh              # Quick build for most users
#   ./build.sh amd          # If you have AMD dedicated GPU
#
